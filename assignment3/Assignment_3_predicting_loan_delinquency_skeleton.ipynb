    "## Predicting Probability of Loan Delinquency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this assignment, we will explore the historical loan data from [lending club](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data/data), and build a very short machine learning pipeline to predict on likelihood of loan delinquency. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### We will start out with inspecting and describing the data, then prepare the dataset for a K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, and evaluate the performance of the algorithm. This exercise walks you through _most_ steps of a machine learning project with much simplicity and focus on data manipulation rather than algorithm training. You are encouraged to check out the [sklearn library](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) and the recommended reading materials this week to learn more about ML!\n",
